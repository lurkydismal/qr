# Code of conduct

The qr project expects qr's contributors to act
professionally and respectfully. qr contributors are expected
to maintain the safety and dignity of qr's social environments (such as GitHub).

Specifically:

* Respect people, their identities, their culture, and their work.
* Be kind. Be courteous. Be welcoming.
* Listen. Consider and acknowledge people's points before responding.

Should you experience anything that makes you feel unwelcome in qr's
community, please contact moderator.

The qr project will not tolerate harassment in qr's
community, even outside of qr's public communication channels.

## Conflict resolution

When multiple contributors disagree on the direction for a particular
patch or the general direction of the project, the conflict should be
resolved by communication. The people who disagree should get
together, try to understand each other's points of view, and work to
find a design that addresses everyone's concerns.

This is usually sufficient to resolve issues. If you cannot come to an
agreement, ask for the advice of a more senior member of the project.

Be wary of agreement by attrition, where one person argues a point
repeatedly until other participants give up in the interest of moving
on. This is not conflict resolution, as it does not address everyone's
concerns. Be wary of agreement by compromise, where two good competing
solutions are merged into one mediocre solution. A conflict is
addressed when the participants agree that the final solution is
_better_ than all the conflicting proposals. Sometimes the solution is
more work than either of the proposals.

Write what you need and no more, but when you write it, do it right.

Avoid implementing features you don't need. You can't design a feature
without knowing what the constraints are. Implementing features "for
completeness" results in unused code that is expensive to maintain,
learn about, document, test, etc.

When you do implement a feature, implement it the right way. Avoid
workarounds. Workarounds merely kick the problem further down the
road, but at a higher cost: someone will have to relearn the problem,
figure out the workaround and how to dismantle it (and all the places
that now use it), _and_ implement the feature. It's much better to
take longer to fix a problem properly, than to be the one who fixes
everything quickly but in a way that will require cleaning up later.

You may hear team members say "embrace the [yak
shave](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/Y/yak-shaving.html)!". This is
an encouragement to [take on the larger effort necessary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0) to perform a
proper fix for a problem rather than just applying a band-aid.

## Questions

It's always ok to ask questions. Our systems are large, and nobody will be
an expert in all the systems. Once you find the answer, document it in
the first place you looked. That way, the next person will be brought
up to speed even quicker.

If I make fun of people, I train them not to tell me when they have those moments. And I miss out on the fun." "Diet coke and mentos thing? What's that?" "Oh, man! We're going to the grocery store."
